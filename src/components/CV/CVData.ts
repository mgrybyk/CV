        `
As a manual QA, I transitioned to the automation/manual QA path where I focused on test design planning,
definition, and review, as well as mentoring others. I also spent time on automation activities,
such as designing SOAP tests (using C#) and automating project configuration with Ranorex (using C#).`,
        `
I built a fully-functional CI pipeline that automated the build, deployment to test environments,
and test execution with nightly and one-button on-demand jobs.
This saved both manual QAs and developers up to half a day daily.`,
        `Additionally, I created a small web app with NodeJS and Angular v1 to monitor and manage test environments.`
